## @Jana Rasras

* Pandas is a package for data manipulation and analysis in Python. 

* Pandas incorporates two additional data structures into Python, namely Pandas Series and Pandas DataFrame.

## Downloading Pandas
> conda install pandas


## P01: Creating Pandas Series
* A Pandas series is a one-dimensional array.
* it  can hold many data types, such as numbers or strings

> main differences between Pandas Series and NumPy ndarrays:
 1. you can assign an index label to each element in the Pandas Series.
 2.  Pandas Series can hold data of different data types.

##  P02 :Accessing and Deleting Elements in Pandas Series
 * Pandas Series have two attributes, .loc and .iloc to explicitly state what we mean. The attribute .loc stands for location and it is used to explicitly state that we are using a labeled index. Similarly, the attribute .iloc stands for integer location and it is used to explicitly state that we are using a numerical index.
